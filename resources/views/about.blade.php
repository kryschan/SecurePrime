                        <p class="mb-4 just rounded wow zoomIn" data-wow-delay="0.6s"><u>SecurePrime</u> acts as an intermediary between the Insured and the Insurer.
                            <br><br>The role of the insurance intermediary developed from a need on the part of the client / policyholder for a “professional” to advise him on the most suitable covers for his business at the most economic cost. 
                            <br><br><u>SecurePrime</u> must therefore be fully conversant with all markets. Each insurance company has its own concept of underwriting and premium rates. These change from time to time so <u>SecurePrime</u> has to keep in touch with these developments. It is neither practical nor cost effective for the client to be similarly conversant with the world’s markets. 
                            <br><br><u>SecurePrime</u> shall inform the client what insurance covers are available in the insurance market, the various rates charged, and any new cover trends, which become available. <u>SecurePrime</u> shall also assist the client or insured in making claims and give him advice as to how his insurance may best be handled. 
                            <br><br>To meet your insurance needs effectively, <u>SecurePrime</u> a trusted business partner–similar to your accountant, banker and attorney. In order to secure the right coverage at an appropriate price, <u>SecurePrime</u> are familiar with all of your insurance programs and services. <u>SecurePrime</u> shall deliver a responsive insurance product that is well priced and deal only with those insurance companies that are financially sound and that could provide service to a level acceptable particularly in respect to their attitude to claims. 
                            <br><br><u>SecurePrime</u> are professionally and creatively market your risks as selection of the best underwriters to deal with is a vital part of our role. 
                            <br><br>A lack of perception of your risks, questions unanswered, and ideas unexplored will surely translate into higher premiums and/or inadequate policy protection. 
                            <br><br>The insurances for a project and the nature of loss may seem uncomplicated, but they do have to be arranged in a technically sophisticated manner in order to provide the essential comfort and protection to shareholders as well as project Financiers. 
                            <br><br>If you have any preference in dealing with any particular insurer then naturally we will give them first opportunity to participate in the insurance program.

                            <br><br>By dealing directly with an insurance company, clients will be restricted to the standard policy that the insurance company can provide.  This may not always be sufficient to meet their needs, particularly with respect to large construction projects.
                            <br><br>SecurePrime has an obligation to ensure that the policy wordings are tailor-made to suit the client’s needs, and embrace the risks and indemnities peculiar to the project.
                            <br><br>SecurePrime therefore should have the facilities and technical expertise to provide the client with alternatives that best fit their insurance needs, and offer specific strategies as required.
